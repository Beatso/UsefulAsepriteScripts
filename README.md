# Simple Aseprite Scripts

This is a small collection of scripts for [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) that I made for personal use. I find them especially useful when creating Minecraft textures.

They are under an [MIT license](https://github.com/Beatso/UsefulAsepriteScripts/blob/master/LICENSE), so feel free to adapt these as much as you like.

Pull requests and issues are very welcome!


## Usage & Installation

Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/Beatso/UsefulAsepriteScripts/releases/latest) and download **Source code (zip)**.  
In Aseprite, press File > Scripts > Open Scripts Folder.  
Extract the zip you downloaded into the scripts folder.  
Back in Aseprite, press File > Scripts > Rescan Scripts Folder.  
You should see the scripts appear under a folder in File > Scripts. Click them to run them.


## Scripts

### Resize Sprite

This resizes an image to a specified size. The actual content inside will stay the same size, but the area around it will grow evenly in every direction.

### Stack Frames

This gets every frame of a sprite and creates a new sprite with the frames stacked on top of each other. This is especially useful for creating animated Minecraft textures.

## Find Midpoint Colours

Finds a customisable number of midpoints between two specified colours.
